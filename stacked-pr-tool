Hi, I'd like you to essentially act as a stacked PR tool.
Use `git log` to look back at the commits from main to HEAD.
You'll see that at certain commits I've left you a message
regarding the tag name that the commit should have and the
branch it should be pushed to. Please carry out what those
instructions ask for. 

Then add text to commits along the lines of

    AI: This commit should have tag name my-pr-branch-name and should be
    force-pushed to a branch of that name as necessary.
